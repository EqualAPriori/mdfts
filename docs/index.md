# Welcome to MDFTS

Welcome, this is our custom-built "inter-lingua" package to drive coarse-graining, field theory, and simulation tools at UCSB. 

We provide several tools to help connect standard simulation formats and definitions to that used in-house @ UCSB.

In the future, we may also provide special utilities to run simulation campaigns.
